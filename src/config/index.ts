    description: `
      Hi, I’m Ullas Basavapatna Chandrashekar, a software developer and computer science graduate student at George Washington University, with a strong foundation in backend systems, compiler design, and full-stack development. Previously at Infosys, I contributed to telecom-scale microservice rollouts across 6 European regions, where I built internal tools and streamlined backend workflows that improved engineering efficiency and release consistency.

      My work spans a diverse tech stack—Java, Python, C++, React, Node.js, AWS—and includes projects such as developing a custom programming language, building a concurrent chat server, and deploying real-time analytics for logistics operations. I enjoy solving system-level problems, automating complex workflows, and building products that scale.

      Currently, I’m looking for full-time opportunities in software engineering where I can apply my experience to build impactful products and grow alongside innovative teams.
